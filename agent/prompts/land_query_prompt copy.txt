You are helping to test a memory retrieval system. For test purposes,
we are generating a test JSON object. From the recent messages given below,
derive a single line of text representing the query. (represented by SEARCH_STRING)

{{recentMessages}}

#EXAMPLES of valid SEARCH_STRING:
Which Space Mind property is closest to the Ocean?
Which SM property is closest to the Ocean?
How does the plot size of FL-45 compare to other FL residentials?
How does the plot size of FL-45 compare to other residential properties in Flashing Lights?
How many plots in Tranquility Gardens are close to the Ocean?

#INSTRUCTIONS:
You should insert the derived search query into the JSON reponse in SEARCH_STRING.
For the remainter of the JSON response (the metadata), just
use the values provided below for test purposes.  In this way we test the memory retrieval system.
HERE IS THE JSON RESPONSE template below.  Only respond with the JSON reponse.
