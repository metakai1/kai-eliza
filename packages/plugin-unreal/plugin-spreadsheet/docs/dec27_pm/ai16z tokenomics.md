### **Key Discussion Points:**

#### **Phase 1 - Launchpad Proposal (Q1 2025):**
- **Objective:** Establish a decentralized launchpad to support Eliza-based projects.
- **Mechanisms:**
  - $ai16z staking for allocations, liquidity pool pairings, and fees from new project launches.
  - Buyback and burn strategies or reinvestment in ecosystem growth.
  - Open-source components and curation by DAO members to maintain quality and decentralization.

#### **Phase 2 - Ecosystem Expansion:**
- **Goal:** Incentivize developers and tie token utility to platform growth, mimicking $ETH or $SOL ecosystems.
- **Incentives:**
  - Revenue sharing, ecosystem funds, and liquidity incentives for projects.
  - AI agent-to-agent transactions denominated in $ai16z.
  - Treasury diversification across stablecoins and major Layer 1 assets.

#### **Phase 3 - Long-Term Vision as AI Infrastructure (L1 for AI):**
- **Outcome:** Position ai16z as a foundational AI blockchain protocol to underpin decentralized AI services.
- **Scaling Strategies:**
  - Node incentives and staking models.
  - Potential integration with other Layer 1 solutions for interoperability.
