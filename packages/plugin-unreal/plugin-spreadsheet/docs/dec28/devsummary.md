# Development Summary - December 28, 2024

## Overview
Today's development focused on upgrading the real estate assistant character and implementing system-wide agent ID updates. The work transformed the previous whimsical character into a professional real estate intelligence system named ATLAS.

## Major Changes

### 1. Character Transformation
- **New Identity**: Created ATLAS (Advanced Technical Listing Analysis System)
  - Replaced previous character with professional real estate focus
  - Implemented comprehensive property knowledge base
  - Enhanced bio and lore to reflect technical expertise

### 2. Agent ID Updates
- **New Agent ID**: `1459b245-2171-02f6-b436-c3c2641848e5`
- **Files Updated**:
  - `.env`: Updated USER_ID
  - `unreal-agent2.test.md`: Updated test configurations
  - `memory-integration.test.ts` and `test2.ts`: Updated test agent IDs
  - `clear_memories.ts`: Updated room ID
  - `embed_test6.ts`: Updated room, user, and agent IDs

### 3. Property Data Implementation
- **Knowledge Base Structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "Property": "Name",
    "Location": "Area",
    "Type": "Usage",
    "Size": "Acreage",
    "Features": "Key Amenities",
    "Market Value": "Current Valuation"
  }
  ```
- **Sample Properties Added**:
  - Oceanview Tower (Mixed-Use)
  - Palm Gardens Complex (Residential)
  - Sunset Plaza (Commercial)
  - Marina Heights (Mixed-Use)
  - Beach Walk Commons (Retail)

### 4. File Management
- Moved character file to proper `characters/` directory
- Updated `.gitignore` to track character files
- Removed deprecated test files
- Consolidated property records in character knowledge base

## Testing & Validation
- Successfully tested property search functionality
  - Example: "search-properties sunset plaza miami beach commercial"
  - System correctly returned property details including size, features, and market value
- Verified agent ID consistency across all system components
- Confirmed character responses maintain professional tone and accurate property information

## Future Enhancements Identified
1. **Property Management Feature**:
   - Implement structured data storage (JSON/CSV)
   - Create property record loader
   - Add market trend analysis
   - Enable detailed property metadata
   - Develop custom search filters

2. **Knowledge Base Expansion**:
   - Add more property records
   - Include market analysis data
   - Implement property categorization
   - Add historical price trends

## Technical Debt Addressed
- Removed outdated character configurations
- Updated all agent ID references
- Cleaned up deprecated test files
- Standardized property data format

## Next Steps
1. Develop property management feature
2. Expand property database
3. Implement advanced search capabilities
4. Add market analysis functionality

## Notes
- Character file schema currently doesn't support dedicated metadata
- Future consideration: Extend schema for structured property data
- Current implementation uses knowledge array for property records
- System demonstrates good performance with basic property queries
