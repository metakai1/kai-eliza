## Basic Concepts

### What is Semantic Search? 🔍
Unlike traditional search that looks for exact matches, semantic search understands the meaning of your query. For example:

```
Traditional: "height > 300 AND ocean_distance < 500"
Semantic:    "tall buildings near the ocean"
```

Both searches find the same properties, but semantic search lets you ask naturally!

### Property Data Structure 📊
Each property in our database has these key attributes:

```typescript
interface PropertyData {
    name: string;              // Building name
    neighborhood: string;      // Location
    zoningType: string;        // Residential, Commercial, etc.
    plotSize: string;         // Giga, Mega, etc.
    buildingSize: string;     // Megatall, Supertall, etc.
    maxFloors: number;        // Number of floors
    minFloors: number;        // For buildings with varying heights
    plotArea: number;         // Land size in square meters
    maxBuildingHeight: number; // Height in meters
    minBuildingHeight: number; // For buildings with varying heights
    oceanDistanceMeters: number; // Distance to ocean
    bayDistanceMeters: number;   // Distance to bay
}
```

## How It Works

### 1. Query Understanding 🧠
When you search, the AI first breaks down your query into structured filters:

```javascript
Query: "Find tall buildings near the ocean in Nexus or Flashing Lights"

// Gets converted to:
{
    "operator": "AND",
    "filters": [
        {
            "field": "maxBuildingHeight",
            "operator": "$gte",
            "value": 300
        },
        {
            "field": "oceanDistanceMeters",
            "operator": "$lte",
            "value": 500
        },
        {
            "operator": "OR",
            "filters": [
                {
                    "field": "neighborhood",
                    "operator": "$eq",
                    "value": "Nexus"
                },
                {
                    "field": "neighborhood",
                    "operator": "$eq",
                    "value": "Flashing Lights"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### 2. Vector Search 🎯
The system converts text descriptions into number vectors that capture meaning:

```javascript
// Your query: "oceanfront property with lots of floors"
// Gets converted to vector (simplified):
[0.2, -0.5, 0.8, 0.1, -0.3]

// Property descriptions are also vectors:
{
    "NX-1": {
        description: "Skyline Tower is a megatall building right by the ocean...",
        vector: [0.21, -0.48, 0.79, 0.15, -0.28]  // Similar = Good match!
    },
    "FL-7": {
        description: "Mountain View Plaza is far from water...",
        vector: [-0.6, 0.3, -0.2, -0.4, 0.5]      // Different = Bad match
    }
}
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Simple Search 🏗️
```javascript
Query: "Find tall buildings near the ocean"

Results:
1. NX-1 (Skyline Tower)
   - Height: 455m ✓
   - Ocean Distance: 294m ✓
   - Match Score: 0.92

2. FL-192 (Ocean Heights)
   - Height: 464m ✓
   - Ocean Distance: 317m ✓
   - Match Score: 0.89

3. FL-163 (Coastal Plaza)
   - Height: 421m ✓
   - Ocean Distance: 462m ✓
   - Match Score: 0.85
```

### Example 2: Complex Query 🌇
```javascript
Query: "residential buildings in Nexus with at least 100 floors that are either near the ocean or near the bay"

Parsed Filters:
{
    "operator": "AND",
    "filters": [
        {
            "field": "zoningType",
            "operator": "$eq",
            "value": "Residential"
        },
        {
            "field": "neighborhood",
            "operator": "$eq",
            "value": "Nexus"
        },
        {
            "field": "maxFloors",
            "operator": "$gte",
            "value": 100
        },
        {
            "operator": "OR",
            "filters": [
                {
                    "field": "oceanDistanceMeters",
                    "operator": "$lte",
                    "value": 500
                },
                {
                    "field": "bayDistanceMeters",
                    "operator": "$lte",
                    "value": 500
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}

Results:
1. NX-1 (Skyline Tower)
   - Zoning: Residential ✓
   - Neighborhood: Nexus ✓
   - Floors: 113 ✓
   - Ocean Distance: 294m ✓
   - Bay Distance: 850m
   - Match Score: 0.94

2. NX-7 (Bay View Residences)
   - Zoning: Residential ✓
   - Neighborhood: Nexus ✓
   - Floors: 105 ✓
   - Ocean Distance: 712m
   - Bay Distance: 382m ✓
   - Match Score: 0.88
```

### Example 3: Fuzzy Matching 🔮
The system understands various ways to ask for the same thing:

```javascript
// All these queries find the same properties:
"tall buildings by the water"
"skyscrapers near ocean"
"high-rise properties close to the sea"
"buildings over 300m height near coast"
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Complex Logic 🧮
You can combine multiple conditions with AND/OR logic:

```javascript
Query: "Find properties that are either:
       - In Nexus with more than 100 floors
       - OR in Flashing Lights near the ocean"

// System understands this complex logic!
```

### 2. Smart Defaults 📏
The system uses sensible defaults for common terms:
- "tall" → height ≥ 300m
- "near water" → distance ≤ 500m
- "large plot" → area ≥ 5000m²

### 3. Ranking 📊
Results are ranked by:
1. Vector similarity (how well they match the query)
2. How many filters they match
3. How close they are to ideal values

## Technical Deep Dive

### Vector Search Implementation 🔬
```typescript
async function findSimilarProperties(query: string, properties: Property[]) {
    // 1. Convert query to vector
    const queryVector = await embedText(query);
    
    // 2. Calculate similarity with each property
    const scored = properties.map(property => ({
        property,
        similarity: cosineSimilarity(
            queryVector,
            property.vector
        )
    }));
    
    // 3. Sort by similarity
    return scored.sort((a, b) => 
        b.similarity - a.similarity
    );
}
```

### Filter Application Logic 🔧
```typescript
function applyFilters(property: Property, filters: FilterGroup): boolean {
    return filters.operator === "AND"
        ? filters.filters.every(f => checkFilter(property, f))
        : filters.filters.some(f => checkFilter(property, f));
}

function checkFilter(property: Property, filter: Filter): boolean {
    const value = property[filter.field];
    switch (filter.operator) {
        case "$gte": return value >= filter.value;
        case "$lte": return value <= filter.value;
        case "$eq": return value === filter.value;
        // ... other operators
    }
}
```

This is just the beginning! The semantic search system continues to learn and improve, understanding more complex queries and providing better matches over time. 🚀
