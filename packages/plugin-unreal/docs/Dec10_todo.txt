TO DO for Dec 11:

- remove sort by cheapest and most expensive queries from
  database search ->  no price data is stored in database.

- add price sorting function to executeSearchV2

- debug system query prompt for follow-up queries

- review main system prompt for better compatibiity with new search
  strategy


- investigate search session enhancements to allow better
  stateful search capabilities by storing and operating on previous results

- test more use cases

- queries such as cheapest/most expensive, etc. should have forSale set to true

- handle case where user asks for which properties are forsale (metadata is empty)

- filter incoming messages by user id to save tokens
